# AgriGO
Rajasthan Hackathon 7.0 Project
**Problem Statement-**
Agriculture Farming is still a challenge. Farmers in villages have no access to new technological development in farming techniques. People who migrated form village but still have parental land and have no knowledge of farming can be hepled with **AgriGo**

**Approach**
-
We have created several features in our app that can help farmers and migrated people to increase their earnnig by doing farming.
Some of our features are - 

1. Crop Prediction using ai

2. Munafa Calculator (according to crop and land area)

3. Voice search in religional languages with help of openAI

4. Kisan call centre button

5. Articles and news on new technologies and farming methods to teach them farming technique such as precision farming.

6. Crop recommendation for better returns on farming

7. support of regional languages

**Our Vision**
-
We want to train AI models on the data set that we have made by ourself.
here is the link of data that we have scrapped from internet during the hackathon- 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jO3EFqhGGmhZovlqXV8qAce4-njZSAnLau3iyqzdBmI/edit?usp=drivesdk

For training of AI model we want to train it on our data set such as **label encoding of feature** which include **state list, district list, soil type in that district** and many more data we can include here such as soil ph, weather condition, time of year, etc.
**one not coding of labels** which include the crops data that can be grown in the region.
with this ai model we will predict the crops that can we grow in particular region.

**Must check Prototype for proper understaning of our mission & vision**

Currently under-development. REST API with MongoDB as database is used to remote services.

**Limitations**
-
• Limited Database.
• Data scrapping for training & research under development.
• App optimization is under development.
